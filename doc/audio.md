Music is very much structured.

Octaves
// Octave 4
`C D E F G A B`

Notes

Beats per minute, exaples are something around (120 - 140).
I appreciate a good beat in music. Syncing sound effects with the music would give a very good feeling.

A note has
- u32 id
- f32 velocity
- f32 time

## Synth design
What is a good design for writing a syntesier in this game?
I want to programattically write the music. That would be cool.
This would involve 'notes' that play on given beats and last for some number of beats.
